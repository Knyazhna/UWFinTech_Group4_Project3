# Project 3: Event Staking
In this project we will utilize smart contracts and minted tokens to create incentive for event attendance after an RSVP.
*   [Sample Staking Repo](https://github.com/SRVng/solidity-avalanche-RSVP-staking-event)

## Problem Statement:
In this post-COVID era, attempting to arrange events both virtually and in-person, has become an increasingly daunting task. 

There are many individuals show initial interest by casually RSVPing to a hosted event; however when the time comes, a fraction, if not a majority, do not attend. This creates a strenuous situation for hosts especially when others are involved such as guest speakers, bands, etc.

In light of these embarassing and far too frequent attendance issues, we have created our last project to inspire hope in those hosts selfless enough to bring people back together [safely]. 

### Problem
Inconsistent event attendance promises in a post-COVID era, creating volatility for hosts thus, decreasing event satisfaction and decentivizing hosts.

### Solution
A Solidity, smart contract supported, event planning platform in which guests RSVP and pay a small amount to a decentralized fund. The inidividuals who RSVP but fail to check in, lose their staked ETH; those who do attend, get their money back and a share of the reward.


## Technologies
* Python
* Brownie
* Solidity
* Streamlit


## Outline

### High-Level: NFT Staking System
1.  An ERC721 will be the NFT (RSVP) token, used to identify owner.
2.  An ERC20 token will be the reward token.
3.  The staking contract will hold the staked nft and will allow claiming the rewards.

### Completion Checkpoints
1. Create Contracts:
	1. ERC20 (EVT) token
	2. ERC721 token
	3. RSVP
	4. Main Contract
	5. Security Contract?
2. Integrate front-end platform with Streamlit
3. Test?
4. Summarize into Powerpoint
5. Present
6. Celebration
